# Example 1

## Description

This is an example of encoding the build of a python wheel publish step, modeling [this github action run](https://github.com/pypa/wheel/actions/runs/8238629017) based on [this workflow definition](https://github.com/pypa/wheel/blob/0.43.0/.github/workflows/publish.yml). This is a handwritten example and encodes the actor, builder, outputs and build elements involved, showing incomplete and noassertion relationship types where information is not available (build host BOM, and tool inputs).
