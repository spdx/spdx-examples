# Example 1 - SEBoK Product as System : Commodity Consumer Electronics

## Description

In this example the "system" is
a commodity-level consumer electronics OEM product (line)
intended to be offered to System Manufacturers initially in the EU and NA markets.

The current product line scope consists of:
  - Rebrandable product-with-digital-elements with a physical communication interface

The current set of products provided by this product line are:
  - TBD


The (re)branding requires setting persistent product identification 
data (digital and physical identifiers) and packaging the product:
  - Manufacturer
  - Marketing Brand
  - Model
  - Serial Number


## Comments

- EU CRA Annex III identifies "physical and virtual network interfaces" as
Important Products with Digital Elements - Class I. 

- EU CRA Article 21 - "Cases in which obligations of manufacturers apply to importers and distributors" states

> An importer or distributor shall be considered to be a manufacturer for the purposes of this Regulation and shall be subject to Articles 13 and 14, where that importer or distributor places a product with digital elements on the market under its name or trademark or carries out a substantial modification of a product with digital elements already placed on the market.

- EU CRA Article 45 states:

> Important products with digital elements as referred to in this Regulation should be understood as products which have the core functionality of a category of important products with digital elements that is set out in this Regulation. ...

Being a commodity-level product:

- the entire software source for this product (other than digital signatures)
  could be provided as FOSS by an Open Source Steward;

- the entire OEM product could be manufactured and provided using commercially
  available computer hardware evaluation kits;
