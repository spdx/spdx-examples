A simple basic Maven Java project with a minimal set of dependencies.

## Comments

### Distinguishing the Test and Runtime dependencies

There are 2 different dependency types.  Using the appropriate relationship types will help downstream tools determine the impact of any licensing or security related issues.

### Package details

The content is derrived from executing the [Maven quickstart archetype](https://maven.apache.org/archetypes/maven-archetype-quickstart/).  A simple dependency has been added.  The result is a POM file with one runtime and one test dependency.

In addition to the standard POM file, the pom-with-spdx-plugin.xml includes an execution of the [SPDX Maven Plugin](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-maven-plugin) which was used to generate the initial output for the SPDX content.

### App class

A simple "Hello world" generated by the Maven quickstart archetype.

### Third party libraries

There is one direct runtime dependency, Apache Log4j SLF4J Binding, and one direct test dependency, JUNIT.
